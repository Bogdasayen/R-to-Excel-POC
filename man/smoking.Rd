\title{Smoking-Related Model Inputs}
\format{
A list with 7 components:
\describe{
  \item{v_names}{A character vector of variable names (length 8).}
  \item{v_descriptions}{A character vector describing each variable (length 8).}
  \item{v_type}{A character vector indicating the type of each variable, e.g., \code{"transition_probability"}, \code{"utility"}, \code{"cost"}, etc. (length 8).}
  \item{v_distributions}{A character vector indicating the probability distribution used for each variable (length 8).}
  \item{m_hyperparameters}{An 8x2 matrix of distribution hyperparameters. The meaning of the two columns depends on the distribution type (e.g., alpha and beta for beta distribution, mean and SD for normal).}
  \item{m_transition}{An 8x2 matrix showing the transition from one health state to another for transition probability variables. \code{NA} for non-transition variables. Columns are \code{from} and \code{to}.}
  \item{v_treatment}{A numeric vector indicating which treatment the variable applies to (1 = SoC, 2 = Website, NA = not treatment-specific).}
  \item{v_state}{A numeric vector indicating which health state the variable applies to (1 = Smoking, 2 = Not smoking, NA = not state-specific).}
}

\description{
A structured list containing inputs for a smoking-related health economic model.
This dataset includes variable names, descriptions, types, distributions, and
associated parameters for use in cost-effectiveness or Markov modeling.
